## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to run the application locally using Docker.

### Prerequisites

‚û°Ô∏è [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) must be installed and running.


### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
    - Open a **terminal** and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project. Then run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CodecoolGlobal/freestyle-mern-project-react-matebukari.git
cd freestyle-mern-project-react-matebukari
```

2. **Rename `example.env` File**
    - In the repository folder you can find the `example.env` file.
    - Rename the `example.env` file to `.env` by simply removing the `example` part.

3. **Start the Application with Docker**
    - Execute the following command in your terminal to build and start the containers:
      ```bash
      docker compose up --build
      ```

4. **Access the Application**
    - Open your browser and visit:  
      [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

5. **Stopping the Application**
    - In your **terminal** press `Ctrl + C`
    - If you want to **stop and remove the containers**, but **keep the database data** for future runs, execute:
      ```bash
      docker compose down
      ```
      In this case, the database will **persist** between runs, and your data will still be available next time you start the application.

    - If you want to **stop, remove the containers and delete the database data**, execute:
      ```bash
      docker compose down -v
      ```
      In this case, the database and all stored data will be completely removed.
